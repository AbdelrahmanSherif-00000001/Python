This is a simple linear regression model to predict the salary of a person based on years of experience.
It draws the regression line against the dataset to show how well the model fits.
This code does not use the scikit-learn library, I wanted to show how the calculations are done manually to make predictions.

The output will be like this: https://github.com/AbdelrahmanSherif-00000001/Python/blob/main/Screenshot%202025-08-17%20032838.png

<br>
what is needed to run and work:
install matplotlib, pandas, numpy as next: 
  pip install <library name> <br>
to run it : 
  python <file name>.py <br>

future work: 
add evaluation method to measure accuracy 
also might update and code it using scikit-learn what do you think and tell me how to add the image after adding it github in details as I can not do this
